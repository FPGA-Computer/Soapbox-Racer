Defect: #1
Level: serious
USB Connector (from con-usb-2.lbr) does not match pinout of FCI connector!
Pin 1 location is wrong and all pins are affected.
See pdf.

Defect: #2
Level: low
Supercap copper footprint is different than layout.  Triangular pad top stop 
opening is square on actual copper.  Board house changed the pad.

Defect: #3
Level: low
LED center of gravity is outside the PCB.

Defect: #4
Level: low
Need pull up for /HDD_LED when ATA HDD is not connected to board.
Amber LED is on all the time when that happens.

Defect: #5
Level low
AUD_EN pull down changed to 4K7 as uninitialized FPGA default internal 
pull up is too strong.  Pin was at ~1V previously, now at 0.495V.  Part is 
to disable audio until FPGA gets configured as CODEC has dynamic logic 
and requires a clock.

Defect: #6
Level: medium
SPI FLASH is 208 mils SOIC8.

Defect #7

Level: Major

ATAPI connector pin 42 is +5V (motor) not GND.

Defect#8

Level: Minor

PTC for HDD has too much voltage drop during startup.   Replace PTC1 with 
a 1.5A 06012 slow blow fuse or 0 ohm jumper and rely on the AP2511 short 
circuit protection on the +UB rail.
