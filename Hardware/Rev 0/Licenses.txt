This covers the project licenses which is quite a mess. This is a
limited open sourced hardware project with some commerial values and the
firmware/ FPGA side of it is dependent on various sources e.g. MPU/compiler 
vendor and various open source projects and my own modifications. 

Some of the more restrictive files (e.g. PCB layout, 3D model) are to
prevent my work being used for someone else's financial gain. e.g.
Chinese clones, Kickstarter scams

Even if I wanted to, I can't give away the schematic/layout files for
commerial purposes unless/until I have a EagleCAD commerial license. So
basically the CAD files all have to be non-commerial with Attribution.

By all means explore the layout/3D models or learn about circuits for
educational purposes. I don't intend to take away those rights.

I am hoping to relax the hardware rights when/if I get a clearer picture
of the commerial side. Can't exactly give everything away right now.

code whenever.

Note:
MiST is the project that gave me the inspiration. Only pdf file are
available, but I learnt from it and designing my own completely from
scratch.
